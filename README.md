# learning-rust

A collection of small projects as I learn rust

## hello-rust

The hello world program covered in the Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html)

## guessing_game

The simple guessing game that is outlined in the Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

## todo_list

A custom interactive CLI tool to manage a to-do list. It allows you to add and edit tasks, mark them as completed, and has a few different ways to remove tasks from the list. Created using the [console](https://crates.io/crates/console) and [dialoguer](https://crates.io/crates/dialoguer) crates to make the tool interactive and pleasant to use.

The next step is to integrate the tool with A SQLite database so that tasks can be saved between executions of the program.

## snake_game

Snake implemented with the [piston_window](https://crates.io/crates/piston_window) crate. Created following along to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT_7M7L7vo&list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDD5vy2BuSHvFZU0a6RDmgb&ab_channel=TensorProgramming) video.
