# learning-rust
A collection of small projects as I learn rust

## hello-rust
The hello world program covered in the Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html)

## guessing_game
The simple guessing game that is outlined in the Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

## todo_list
A custom interactive CLI tool to manage a to-do list. It allows you to add and edit tasks, mark them as completed, and has a few different ways to remove tasks from the list. Created using the [console](https://crates.io/crates/console) and [dialoguer](https://crates.io/crates/dialoguer) crates to make the tool interactive and pleasant to use. 

The next step is to integrate the tool with A SQLite database so that tasks can be saved between executions of the program.
